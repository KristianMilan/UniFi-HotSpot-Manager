# UniFi HotSpot Manager
This is a HotSpot Manager like the default one of [UniFi Ubiquiti](https://unifi-sdn.ubnt.com/), but this one has some advantages and is easier to use.

## Features
- allow different Usergroups via Voucher prefixes with just one [Ubiquiti Controller] ;)
- own user access control, no need for users to get a real admin account on the [Ubiquiti Controller]
- variable printing, creating, filtering and deleting of vouchers
- deleting multiple vouchers with _one click_ just works, but the needed time is about 0.8 seconds per voucher :(
- blocking, unblocking and re-connecting of users (the default HotSpot system misses these functions, but the admin interface has, yes I know... but this is not for users)
- ... a lot more, this is just the first writing of that README

## Included libraries
- [UniFi PHP API](https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client), by [Erik Slooff](https://github.com/malle-pietje)

- an [Ubiquiti Controller]
- a webserver wit PHP >= 5.5
- some time for installing and testing

## Installation
- clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/mcmilk/UniFi-HotSpot-Manager`
- the `private` folder can be setup to some private directory (not meant to stay in webroot)
- the file `index.php` should be copied to your web folder
- edit the file then, and set up the private path
- then go to your `private` path an take a look into the file `config.sample.php`
- modify that file and rename it to `config.php`
- start your browser and you should get the login form
- take a look into the file `userdb.json`, search for `pass = [` and use this password together with the username `admin` 
- for creating an own qr-code of the WiFi settings for your network on the vouchers, just use the script provided here: `contrib/qr-gen.sh`

## Todo
- show some more information on the "list_clients" action
- the same for the "list_guest_aps" site
